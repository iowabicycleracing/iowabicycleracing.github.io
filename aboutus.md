## Our Mission
The mission of The Iowa Bicycle Racing Association is to grow competitive cycling in Iowa and assist our athletes in achieving sustained success in national cycling competition.

We will accomplish this by:

* Assist race organizers with the resources to create safe and challenging events that welcome new racers and experienced veterans alike.
* Provide and promote incentive and educational programs for athletes and officials.
