The IBRA board is seeking nominations for new board members to promote bicycle racing in Iowa. The board is responsible for promoting local racing by working with racers and race promoters to produce quality events. In particular, the board is wrestling with the following topics as we look to the future: 
 
- Officials shortage – There are about eight active officials in the state of Iowa trying to cover all of the events. How does IBRA attract and retain officials to maintain high quality events.
- Event promotion and scheduling – The impact of gravel events on the road, mountain and cyclocross calendars is significant. How does the board engage all race promoters to build a calendar that accommodates all events?
 
If you are interested in helping shape the future of racing in Iowa, please nominate yourself, or someone you know that would be interested. Nominations are open until Dec. 15.
